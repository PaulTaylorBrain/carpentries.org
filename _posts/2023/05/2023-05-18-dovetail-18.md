This is the eighteenth post in [a series that we are calling "The Dovetail",
about the transition to The Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-dovetail) (our new lesson infrastructure).

## All of our official lessons now use The Carpentries Workbench

I am pleased to announce that as of 2023-05-15 16:18 UTC, all of the official
Carpentries Lessons now use [The Carpentries
Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/).

If you are curious about some of the differences between The Workbench and styles,
we have detailed these in [the Transition Guide](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/transition-guide.html).


## Processing Outstanding Pull Requests

One impact of the infrastructure transition is that any open pull requests on lesson repositories will be invalidated when the change takes place. To avoid this, **Maintainers are working hard to process outstanding pull requests on their lesson repositories this month**. You can expect to see plenty of activity on GitHub. If you were planning to submit a change to a Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, or Software Carpentry lesson, **we recommend that you wait until after the transition has taken place before you open any new PRs**.

Huge thanks go to all of the Maintainers who are devoting extra time and effort to help prepare for this transition. This process is particularly demanding for the Maintainer community, and we realy appreciate the cooperation and positivity that we have received from them.

# Enable repository from carpentries
options(repos = c(
  ropensci = 'https://carpentries.r-universe.dev',
  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
# Download and install sandpaper in R
install.packages(c('tinkr', 'pegboard', 'sandpaper', 'varnish'))
