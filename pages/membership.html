---

<p>A Member Organisation is an organisation which has made a commitment to the growth and spread of The Carpentries. Members receive priority access to <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/">Instructor Training</a> and guidance with capacity building at their organisation. With local Instructors, Member organisations can readily run low-cost local <a href="/workshops/">workshops</a>. Community-developed lessons enable our Instructors to globally share the effort for developing impactful lessons on technical topics. Memberships give The Carpentries revenue to ensure the ongoing development and maintenance of the lessons demanded by research communities. We also work to give your local Instructors support, mentorship, and a forum for community lesson development.</p>
<h3 id="membership-tiers">Membership Levels</h3>
<p>We offer five customizable Membership levels, based on training activities expected annually. The cost for each Membership level is dependent on the
purchasing organisation&#39;s geographic location, according to the
<a href="https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/the-world-by-income-and-region.html">World Bank&#39;s</a> gross national income 
categorisation.</p>
